#Loading the data
import numpy as np

# We will load the data with pd
import pandas as pd

# We start by defining the path to the file that we're we need to load.
# Upon inspection, we saw that the messy_data.data was infact a file in the
# format of a CSV-file with a ".data" extention instead.  
#file_path = r'C:/Users/ritux/OneDrive - Danmarks Tekniske Universitet/Skrivebord/DTU/1 6ยบ Semester/1 3 02450 Machine Learning/Project 2/glass.data'
# First of we simply read the file in using readtable, however, we need to
# tell the function that the file is tab-seperated. We also need to specify
# that the header is in the second row:
data = pd.read_csv("glass.data", sep=',', header=None)


""" Preparing the Data"""

#Raw data
raw_data = data.values

# The last column is an integer for the glass type (Classes)
#We decide to extract this in a variable for itself

#Continuous data

#Sutracting 1 from all values to a true ratio
RI_Ratio = np.array([ RI_Element-1 for RI_Element in D[:,0]])
D[:,0]=RI_Ratio

#Defining the data as X
X = D

#Shape of data
N, M = D.shape

#Standardizing and then doing the same plots and computations
# Subtract the mean from the data
Y1 = X - np.ones((N, 1))*X.mean(0)

# Subtract the mean from the data and divide by the attribute standard
# deviation to obtain a standardized dataset:
Y2 = X - np.ones((N, 1))*X.mean(0)
Y2 = Y2*(1/np.std(Y2,0))
# Here were utilizing the broadcasting of a row vector to fit the dimensions 
# of Y2

mu = np.mean(X[:, :], 0)
sigma = np.std(X[:, :], 0)
